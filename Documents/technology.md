# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Both raw and derived data will be loaded into a PostgreSQL database.  After processing the data via SQL commands, the results will be output into a CSV file which will be imported into a dataframe for the machine learning portion. 

## Machine Learning
Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost have been evaluated. The tentative plan is to use XGBoost for the ML portion. 

## Dashboard
Tableau and Google Slides will be used for the presentation. The Tableau story board will have interactive features.
